## Navigating the Repository

### 1. data

This folder contains the data (all in csv format) we are using to train and test our algorithms.

### 2. util.py

This file contains all the utility functions used in our algorithms/evaluation.

### 3. experiments.py

This file prepares the data and can be used for experiments using different models/parameters from util.py.

### 4. imdb_training.py

This file contains training models on the data entries in IMDB-Movie-Data.csv.
Please ignore this file as it is not used in our final report.

## Playing with the Models
TL;DR: run **python3 experiments.py** to see the results using the final models discussed in our final report.

To understand how we implemented the algorithms, please read the code and comments in util.py and experiments.py as well as our final report.
